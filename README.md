# sysman
My attempt at creating a systems management console

This is a basic wrapper.  The intention is that it should bring together Terraform and Ansible
to allow the scripted creation and configuration of virtual machines.
This should work for both local and cloud based servers.  A true "hybrid" cloud solution!

Note that this will not be an all singing and all dancing turnkey console but should ease the load
of hard working sysadmins.

A knowledge of how Terraform and Ansible work is essential for this.
